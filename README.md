## Installation

To use the server you need to have installed Python.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This script is ready to work and store data in a SQLite database. 

Also to compile or modify the app you will need to install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

## Usage
The command to use Python will depend on the operating system; typically, in Ubuntu, *python3* is used, and in Windows, *python*. However, it will all depend on your Python installation on the system.

To run the script with the MongoDB database.
```bash
python3 server.py
```
